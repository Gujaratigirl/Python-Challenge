# Python-Challenge
## HW files are Banks.py and Polls.py
All other files are for practice and testing.

## Challenge was attempted 
Folder Challenge file name paragraph2.py for the Paragraph challenge.  
Was not able to figure out how to count sentances when on different lines.  Only when on 1 line but I think it can be accomplished with sentance_count += 1 but ran out of time.
The Boss challenge wasn't attempted.
